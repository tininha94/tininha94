<h2>HI, I'm Cristina Prevides ðŸ‘‹ </h2>


I'm a newbie developer with a lot of willingness to learn. I'm passionate about new technologies and I'm very interested in web and mobile 
development, specially Back-end. I seek to work and develop projects that challenge me and stimulate my continuous growth. I'm here to learn and to contribute.
